title: About Ashley Beckman
---

My name is Ashley Beckman. I am a junior attending the University of Nebraska Lincoln in the College of Journalism where I study Sports Media and Communitations with a minor in Business Administration. 
I was born and raised in Lincoln, Ne but my family currently resides on Sandy Pointe Lake in Ashland, Ne. We have grown up on the water and love to spend time together skiing, wakeboarding or tubing. We got a new boat this year so I am looking forward to trying out surfing! 
I am an intern with the Nebraska Athletic Marketing Department where I oversee Men's Basketball and Men and Women Tennis. I have had the opportunity to meet coaches and players and got to work alongside large companies to design and create t shirts or giveaway ideas. I will be continuing this internship throughout my Senior year and look forward to making many more connections!
